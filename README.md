This script demonstrates how to train a linear regression model using scikit-learn to predict house prices based on square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms. The script reads training and test datasets from CSV files, trains the model, makes predictions on the test set, and saves these predictions to a new CSV file. Additionally, it plots the actual prices from the training set and the predicted prices from the test set, providing a visual comparison of the model's performance.
